Goal:
^(?!(.*youtube.com/watch.*)).*$

Things that worked:
^(.*youtube.com/watch.*)$
^((.*youtube.com/watch.*))$
^((.*youtube.com/watch)).*$

To try:
^.*youtube.com.$

Do not work:
^(?!(.*youtube.com/watch)).*$
^(?=(.*youtube.com/watch)).*$
^.*youtube.com(?!/results|/watch)

Plan: Remove some of the stuff that blocks google and blocks illinois

To do next:

1. Reload the content blocker automatically on load
2. Make pretty gui with Button / switch
3. Design a logo

This stack overflow post explains how to open the safari console dom inspector for safari running on a simulator or on your actual device. That way, we can see the actual dom elements that we need to remove.

Currently, I'm trying to reload the content blocker information at the start loading of the app. But I keep getting thise error: 
In SceneDelegate.swift : 
SFContentBlockerManager.reloadContentBlocker(
            withIdentifier: "com.example.FeedAway.FeedRemover",
            completionHandler: { (maybeErr: Error?) -> Void in
            if let err = maybeErr {
                NSLog("Error reloading Content Blocker:")
                NSLog(err.localizedDescription)
            } else {
                NSLog("Finished reloading Content Blocker")
            }
        })

This error even shows up when I close all apps running on the simulator and then relaunch the app. 

However, if I keep all apps open and I go to Settings -> Safari -> ContentBlockers -> Disable FeedAway, Then relaunch the app, I get 
2020-04-26 19:16:31.254833-0500 FeedAway[71662:483696] Finished reloading Content Blocker

If I change it to withIdentifier: "com.example.FeedAway.FeedRemover", , I get

And If I disable Feedaway in settings, and use withIdentifier: "com.example.FeedAway.FeedRemover", I get
2020-04-26 19:17:27.957995-0500 FeedAway[71722:485311] The operation couldn’t be completed. (SFErrorDomain error 1.)

This indicates that I got the FeedBlocker identifier correct, but there seems to be issues with reloading a content blocker that is Currently active. Thus, I n


I think I'm reloading incorrectly. I need to figure out a way to reload a content blocker that is current active. 
This stack overflow post seems promising, but is not answered yet: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61411329/how-to-reload-content-blockers-while-they-are-active

Update: I fixed this problem!!! 

It turns out, the reload only fails when the json is invalid. I was originally purposefully making the json invalid so that the content blocker wouldn't block the correct content, 
but that strategy wasn't a good idea in general. Now, when I relaunch the application, it automatically gets updated with the new json. 

I can also now test the json when starting the app because it will give a reload error if the json is invalid (This appears to be the only reason reload returns an error)


Next step: try to read through stack overflow posts to get an idea of how to use content blocker extension code.

I was able to see how to check to see if facebook was installed. 

I had to add 'fb' key to the Info.plist file, and then use UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(fbUrl! as URL) to see if I can open "fb://" (As shown in code)

To do next: Figure out how to dynamically modify the json that the content blocker reloads. 
Done!

Check to see if the content blocker has been enabled in settings before showing user options

To add to facebook.json if I want to remove my name:

        },
        "trigger": {
            "url-filter": ".*facebook.com.*"
        }
    },
    {
