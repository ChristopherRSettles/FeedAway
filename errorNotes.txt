Error notes:

-canOpenURL: failed for URL: "fb://" - error: "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (OSStatus error -10814.)"

This error means that the page could not be opened by the app, so therefore this is expected when the app in not installed. 

===================

For a while I was getting: 

Bundle.main.url(forResource: "blockerList", withExtension: "json")
returning nil. 

I followed this post to fix it:
